I created a CSV randomly assigning data to an area then standardized the names and finally added a new coloumn showing unqiue data for each road type.

1. Install the prerequisites as provided in "requirement.txt"
2. python app.py
3. Deliverable: You get the new file which I have also pasted here "enriched_data.xlsx"
