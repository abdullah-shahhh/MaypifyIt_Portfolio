1. I used Pakistans Provincial Boundary and extracted only Balochistans Boundary Shapefile
2. I used an old Universities Point file I had and clipped it with the Polygon Shp
3. Deliverable 1: The universities that fall under balochistan were clipped
4. Deliverable 2: Then I added a buffer zone of 10KMS around each university in balochistan.
5. Screenshots are attached.
